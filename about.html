            <p>Famfik Kindergarten is a growing and versatile community serving Nigerian families with children. We want to create a good and memorable day for every child.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Famfik is a long tradition family business and we act as a partner for Lagos state government in early childhood education  for families with children. We serve family-friendly companies that provide childcare as an employment benefit to their own employees. We help families balance the needs of children and adults for a smooth everyday life.</p>
            <br>
            <p>We have Afternoon clubs for small school children, usually first and second graders. Afternoon clubs are most often held in children’s schools so that children can stay in the club right after the school day. In the afternoon clubs, we want to support the children to have a healthy and balanced day where the right to leisure, rest, play and care is realized. Famfik has afternoon activities in all 6 kindergartens in Victoria Island, Lekki Phase II, Palmgroove, Festac, Ketu and Maryland.</p>
